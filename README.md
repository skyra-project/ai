## Description

For a long time we have had games that the users of [Skyra] could play. These games however have always been limited to be played against other users as we had no good way for [Skyra] to be make moves, that would not also make the game way too easy for the users to win. To solve this problem we have made @skyra/ai, an advanced gaming AI for games in [Skyra] making her a serious opponent that will give you a run for your shinies. We have opted to use C++ alongside node-addon-api for this project as it grants us the best performance and memory management for the AI.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @skyra/ai
```
